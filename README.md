# Coding Challenges

I will be solving different challenges to practise my JavaScript skills. At the end of each one, you will find some test they have to pass. I am using Quokka to check them. The first five challenges will be from freeCodeCamp.

### 1 - Palindrome

A palindrome is a word or sentence that's spelled the same way both forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.
Return true if the given string is a palindrome. Otherwise, return false.

### 2 - Number to Roman

Convert the given Arabic number into a Roman numeral.
Roman numerals Arabic numerals
M 1000
CM 900
D 500
CD 400
C 100
XC 90
L 50
XL 40
X 10
IX 9
V 5
IV 4
I 1

### 3 - Ceasar Cipher

In a shift cipher the meanings of the letters are shifted by some set amount.
A common modern use is the ROT13 cipher, where the values of the letters are shifted by 13 places. Thus A ↔ N, B ↔ O and so on.
Write a function which takes a ROT13 encoded string as input and returns a decoded string.
All letters will be uppercase. Do not transform any non-alphabetic character (i.e. spaces, punctuation), but do pass them on.

### 4 - Telephone Number Validator

Check if the passed string looks like a valid US phone number. The user may fill out the form field any way they choose as long as it has the format of a valid US number.
The area code is required. If the country code is provided, you must confirm that the country code is 1. Return true if the string is a valid US phone number; otherwise return false.
